                <p>This semester has taught me a lot about who I am and how I can better myself to become a better person. I have discovered that my ideal self is someone who can socialize with others while remaining in her comfort zone and who is intelligent enough to make better decisions in life. However, I have also discovered that my actual self is someone who is quiet most of the time, does not socialize with others, struggles with making decisions, and makes a lot of mistakes. However, this is precisely the reason I need to start improving myself in order to develop into a better person. And I need this subject to help me become the person I want to be. In this blog, I will be sharing all of the activities that we went through during the full semester, and I will explain what I have learnt and how I have applied my learnings to myself to become my ideal self.</p>
